# EHA Academy â€“ Advanced JavaScript Practice

This repository is dedicated to my journey through **EHA Academy**, where Iâ€™m focusing on mastering **Advanced JavaScript** concepts and best practices.

Each folder in this repo represents a specific concept, topic, or module worked on during the course. Iâ€™ll be pushing code regularly as I practice, build, and grow in my understanding.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

Each folder is named according to the topic or task covered. For example:

- `eha-environment-setup` â€“ Project setup, tooling, configuration
- `eha-async-js` â€“ Working with asynchronous JavaScript
- `eha-error-handling` â€“ Deep dive into handling errors in JS
- `eha-data-manipulation` â€“ Data transformation and object handling

More folders will be added as I progress through the program.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

- To **track my learning progress**
- To **develop consistency** through regular coding
- To **build a reference** I can revisit and expand on
- To **share my journey** in public and stay accountable

---

## ðŸš€ Consistency is Key

This repo is a log of real, consistent effortâ€”learning by doing. I aim to push code frequently and keep improving every step of the way.
