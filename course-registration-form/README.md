##Through this project, I learned how to manage form state in React using the useState hook and implement comprehensive validation logic. I gained experience in handling form submissions, displaying conditional error messages, and separating component logic from styling for better code organization. This assignment helped me understand the importance of user feedback through validation messages and success notifications.
